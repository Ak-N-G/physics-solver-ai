# ⚛️ Physics Question Solver AI

A lightweight single-repo app that lets you ask physics questions and receive step-by-step answers generated by a Gemini model via a small Express backend.

This branch focuses on frontend modernization and developer ergonomics: extracted assets, improved UX, and client-side math rendering.

Live demo (original): https://ak-n-g.github.io/physics-solver-ai/

## Highlights

- Responsive, modernized frontend (`public/index.html` and `index.html`).
- Static assets extracted to `public/assets/` and duplicated under `assets/` for static hosting.
- KaTeX added for LaTeX rendering in answers (inline `$...$` and display `$$...$$`).
- `server.js` reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `PORT` from environment variables for safer deployment.

## Quickstart (local)

Requirements: Node.js 16+ and npm

1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the server (set your Gemini key)

```powershell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_real_gemini_key_here"; npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3001/` (default port `3001`) to use the UI.

Notes:
- The frontend defaults to POSTing to `/ask-gemini` so serving `public/` through `server.js` is the simplest deployment.
- To host frontend and backend separately, set `window.SERVER_ENDPOINT` (backend base URL) before loading the page or edit the API URL in `assets/js/app.js`.

## KaTeX (math rendering)

KaTeX is loaded from a CDN in both `public/index.html` and `index.html`. The frontend attempts to render LaTeX expressions contained in AI answers using the auto-render extension. Use:

- Inline math: `$E = mc^2$`
- Display math: `$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x} dx = 1$$`

KaTeX is configured with `throwOnError: false` so rendering errors won't break the UI. If you prefer local hosting of KaTeX, I can vendor it under `public/assets/vendor/katex/`.

---

## File map (important files)

- `server.js` — Express backend with `/ask-gemini` route. Provide `GEMINI_API_KEY` in environment for production.
- `public/index.html` — Frontend served by the Express server.
- `index.html` — Static copy for GitHub Pages or other static hosts.
- `public/assets/css/styles.css`, `public/assets/js/app.js` — Extracted frontend assets (duplicates exist under `assets/` for static root).

---

## Notes & deployment

- No deployment configuration files were changed. When deploying to a platform (Render, Vercel, etc.) set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the platform's environment settings.
- Co-hosting frontend and backend on the same origin (default behavior) is the simplest option.
